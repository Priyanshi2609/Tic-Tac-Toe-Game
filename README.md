# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project features a secure user authentication system and a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game. Users can register and log in with token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). Once authenticated, two players can start a game, with logic to track turns, validate moves, enforce rules, and declare a winner or draw, ensuring a fair and engaging experience.
